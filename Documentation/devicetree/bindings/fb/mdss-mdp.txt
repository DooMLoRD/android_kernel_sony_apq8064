- reg :			offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names :		names to refer to register sets related to this device
- interrupts :		Interrupt associated with MDSS.
- vdd-supply :		Phandle for vdd regulator device node.

Example:
	qcom,mdss_mdp@fd900000 {
		compatible = "qcom,mdss_mdp";
		reg = <0xfd900000 0x22100>,
			<0xfd924000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "mdp_phys", "vbif_phys";
		interrupts = <0 72 0>;
		vdd-supply = <&gdsc_mdss>;
	};
