* Qualcomm HDMI Tx

Required properties:
- cell-index: hdmi tx controller index
- compatible: must be "qcom,hdmi-tx"
- reg: offset and length of the register regions(s) for the device.
- reg-names: a list of strings that map in order to the list of regs.

- <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node.
- <compatible-name>-supply-names: a list of strings that map in order
  to the list of supplies.
- <<compatible-name>-supply-type: a type of supply(ies) mentioned above.
    0 = supply with controlled output
    1 = supply without controlled output. i.e. voltage switch
- <compatible-name>-min-voltage-level: specifies minimum voltage level
  of supply(ies) mentioned above.
- <compatible-name>-max-voltage-level: specifies maximum voltage level
  of supply(ies) mentioned above.
- <compatible-name>-op-mode: specifies optimum operating mode of
  supply(ies) mentioned above.

- gpios: specifies gpios assigned for the device.
- <compatible-name>-gpio-names: a list of strings that map in order to
  the list of gpios
