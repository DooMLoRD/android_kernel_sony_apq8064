Qualcomm Modem Boot Authenticator Peripheral Image Loader

pil-mba is a peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is used for loading
modem images using the self-authenticating hardware and software features
of the Modem Boot Authenticator.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,pil-mba"
- reg:		      Two pairs of physical base addresses and sizes. The
		      first corresponds to the Relay Message Buffer (RMB)
		      register base. The second specifies the address at which
		      the primary modem image metadata should be stored.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "modem"

Optional properties:
- qcom,depends-on:    firmware-name of a prerequisite image that must already
		      be running.

Example:
	qcom,mba@fc820000 {
		compatible = "qcom,pil-mba";
		reg = <0xfc820000 0x0020>,
		      <0x0d1f0000 0x4000>;

		qcom,firmware-name = "modem";
		qcom,depends-on    = "mba";
	};
