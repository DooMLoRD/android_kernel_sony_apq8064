* Qualcomm WCNSS Pronto Peripheral Image Loader

pil-pronto is a peripheral image loading (PIL) driver. It is used for loading
Pronto firmware images for wireless connectivity subsystems into memory and
preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It is also used for
shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible: "pil-pronto"
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device. The first pair
       corresponds to PRONTO_PMU, the second pair corresponds to CLK_CTL_WCNSS
       the third pair corresponds to WCNSS_HALTREQ.
- vdd_pronto_pll-supply: regulator to supply pronto pll.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "wcnss"

Example:
	qcom,pronto@fb21b000 {
		compatible = "qcom,pil-pronto";
		reg = <0xfb21b000 0x3000>,
		      <0xfc401700 0x4>,
		      <0xfd485300 0xc>;
		vdd_pronto_pll-supply = <&pm8941_l12>;

		qcom,firmware-name = "wcnss";
	};
