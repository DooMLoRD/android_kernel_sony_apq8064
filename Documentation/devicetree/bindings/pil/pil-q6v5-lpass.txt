Qualcomm LPASS QDSP6v5 Peripheral Image Loader

pil-qdsp6v5-lpass is a peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is used for
loading QDSP6v5 (Hexagon) firmware images for Low Power Audio Subsystems
into memory and preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It's
also responsible for shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,pil-q6v5-lpass"
- reg:		      Two pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes
		      of memory mapped registers. The first region corresponds
		      to QDSP6SS_PUB, and the second to LPASS_HALTREQ.
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "lpass"

Example:
	qcom,lpass@fe200000 {
	        compatible = "qcom,pil-q6v5-lpass";
	        reg = <0xfe200000 0x00100>,
	              <0xfd485100 0x00010>;

	        qcom,firmware-name = "lpass";
	};
