MSM Bus Scaling Driver

The msm bus scaling driver provides the ability to configure
bus performance parameters across the entire chip-set.
Various clients use MSM scaling APIs to request bandwidth
between multiple master-slave pairs. The bus driver then finds
the optimal path between the master and the slave, and aggregates
the bandwidth and clock requests for all master-slave pairs on
that path, and programs hardware accordingly.

The device-tree data required for bus-scaling can be embedded within
the clients' device nodes. The clients can register with the bus driver
using the following properties:

- qcom,msm_bus,name:		String representing the client-name
- qcom,msm_bus,num_cases:	Total number of usecases
- qcom,msm_bus,active_only:	Context flag for requests in active or
				dual (active & sleep) contex
- qcom,msm_bus,num_paths:	Total number of master-slave pairs
- qcom,msm_bus,vectors:		Arrays of unsigned integers representing:
				master-id, slave-id, arbitrated bandwidth,
				instantaneous bandwidth

Example:

	qcom,msm_bus,name = "client-name";
	qcom,msm_bus,num_cases = <3>;
	qcom,msm_bus,active_only = <0>;
	qcom,msm_bus,num_paths = <2>;
	qcom,msm_bus,vectors =
			<22 512 0 0>, <26 512 0 0>,
			<22 512 320000 320000000>, <26 512 3200000 320000000>,
			<22 512 160000 160000000>, <26 512 1600000 160000000>;
