MSM Bus Scaling Driver

The msm bus scaling driver provides the ability to configure
bus performance parameters across the entire chip-set.
Various clients use MSM scaling APIs to request bandwidth
between multiple master-slave pairs. The bus driver then finds
the optimal path between the master and the slave, and aggregates
the bandwidth and clock requests for all master-slave pairs on
that path, and programs hardware accordingly.

The device-tree data required for bus-scaling can be embedded within
the clients' device nodes. The clients can register with the bus driver
using the following properties:

- qcom,msm-bus,name:		String representing the client-name
- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases:	Total number of usecases
- qcom,msm-bus,active-only:	Context flag for requests in active or
				dual (active & sleep) contex
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths:	Total number of master-slave pairs
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps:	Arrays of unsigned integers representing:
				master-id, slave-id, arbitrated bandwidth
				in KBps, instantaneous bandwidth in KBps

Example:

	qcom,msm-bus,name = "client-name";
	qcom,msm-bus,num-cases = <3>;
	qcom,msm-bus,active-only = <0>;
	qcom,msm-bus,num-paths = <2>;
	qcom,msm-bus,vectors =
			<22 512 0 0>, <26 512 0 0>,
			<22 512 320000 3200000>, <26 512 3200000 3200000>,
			<22 512 160000 1600000>, <26 512 1600000 1600000>;
