* Power Management boot configuration (pm-boot)

Low power management drivers need to specify the warmboot entry path for the
application processors to resume from sleep/suspend. The boot configuration
can vary if the core does/does not support a secure boot mode. The secure
boot configuration boots the core sets up the core sub system registers and
calls into the kernel entry point. In the absence of a secure boot mode, the
core when powered on from reset will need to be configured with the warmboot
entry pointer. The physical and the virtual address for the entry pointer
need to provided to the driver.


The device tree parameters for pm-boot are:

Required parameters:

- compatible: Must be "qcom,pm-boot"
- qcom,mode: The mode that the target will use for booting
	MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_TZ                = 0,
	MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_RESET_VECTOR_PHYS = 1,
	MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_RESET_VECTOR_VIRT = 2,
	MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_REMAP_BOOT_ADDR   = 3,

Optional parameters (based on the mode chosen):

- qcom,phy-addr: The physical address that will be used for warmboot entry if
	the processor remap register can be programmed.
	Needed for modes = { MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_RESET_VECTOR_PHYS,
				MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_REMAP_BOOT_ADDR }
- qcom,virt-addr: The virtual address at which the processor start booting from
	Needed for modes = { MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_RESET_VECTOR_VIRT,
				MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_REMAP_BOOT_ADDR }


Example:

	qcom,pm-boot {
		compatible = "qcom,pm-boot";
		qcom,mode = <0>; /* MSM_PM_BOOT_CONFIG_TZ */
	};
