DCVS Core Info

This data describes specific DCVS tuning data for a specific core (CPU, GPU,
etc).

Required properties:

- qcom,core-max-time-us:	Maximum time limit in micorseconds for switching clock rate.
				Limited to this value if switching time takes longer than this limit. Typical value is 100000.
- qcom,algo-slack-time-us:	Time in microseconds after which the QoS guarantee will kick in
				and the clock rate will increased as necessary. Typical value is about 30000.
- qcom,algo-disable-pc-threshold:	If core frequency (kHz) is higher than this value, power collapse is disallowed. Set to 0 for GPU.
- qcom,algo-ss-window-size:	Steady state window size in microseconds.
- qcom,algo-ss-util-pct:	When determining the steady state level, this percentage value is used to provide headroom
				from the utilized cpu to the selected level.
- qcom,algo-ee-max-util-pct:	When determining the level with the lowest energy, any level that exceeds this busy
				percentage, for the measured work in the last window, is disqualified for performance reasons.
- qcom,algo-ss-iobusy-conv:	Used to convert correlation time into assumed IO Busy time, which is removed
				from measured elapsed time when computing cpu utilization.


A number of frequency levels are represented as sub-nodes:

required properties:
- reg:			The index of the frequency entry
- qcom,freq		The frequency of the DVS entry (in kHZ)
- qcom,idle-energy: 	The idle energy cost of the entry (in micro watts)
- qcom,active-energy:	The active energy cost of the entry (in micro watts)
