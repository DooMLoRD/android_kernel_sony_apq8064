* MSM Sleep status

MSM Sleep status device is used to check the power collapsed status of a
offlined core. The core that initiates the hotplug would wait on the
sleep status device before CPU_DEAD notifications are sent out. Some hardware
devices require that the offlined core is power collapsed before turning off
the resources that are used by the offlined core.

This device is dependent on the pm-8x60 device, which configures the low power
mode of respective cores. The sleep status is only valid when the core enters
a low power mode. The device is a child node to pm-8x60 node which is documented
in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/pm-8x60.txt

The required properties of sleep status device are:

- compatible: qcom,cpu-sleep-status
- reg: physical address of the sleep status register for Core 0
- qcom,cpu-alias-addr - On MSM chipset, the each cores registers are at a
	fixed offset each other.
- qcom,cpu-sleep-status-mask - The bit mask within the status register that
	indicates the Core's sleep state.

Example:
	qcom,cpu-sleep-status@f9088008 {
		compatible = "qcom,cpu-sleep-status";
		reg = <0xf9088008 0x4>;
		qcom,cpu-alias-addr = <0x10000>;
		qcom,sleep-status-mask= <0x80000>;
	};
