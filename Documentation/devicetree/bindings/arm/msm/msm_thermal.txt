MSM thermal driver (MSM_THERMAL)

MSM_THERMAL is a kernel platform driver which regulates thermal conditions
on the device during kernel boot. The goal of MSM_THERMAL is to prevent the
temperature of the system from exceeding a thermal limit at which it cannot
operate. Examples are CPU junction thermal limit, or POP memory thermal limit.
The MSM_THERMAL driver polls the TSENS sensor hardware during boot, and
reduces the maximum CPU frequency allowed in steps, to limit power/thermal
output when a threshold temperature is crossed. It restores the maximum CPU
frequency allowed in the same stepwise fashion when the threshold temperature
(with hysteresis gap) is cleared.

The devicetree representation of the MSM_THERMAL block should be:

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,msm-thermal"
- qcom,sensor-id: The id of the TSENS sensor polled for temperature.
			Typically the sensor closest to CPU0.
- qcom,poll-ms: Sampling interval to read sensor, in ms.
- qcom,limit-temp: Threshold temperature to start stepping CPU down, in degC.
- qcom,temp-hysteresis: Degrees below threshold temperature to step CPU up.
- qcom,freq-step: Number of frequency steps to take on each CPU mitigation.

Example:

	qcom,msm-thermal {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-thermal";
		qcom,sensor-id = <0>;
		qcom,poll-ms = <250>;
		qcom,limit-temp = <60>;
		qcom,temp-hysteresis = <10>;
		qcom,freq-step = <2>;
	};
