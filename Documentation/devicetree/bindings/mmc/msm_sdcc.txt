Qualcomm Secure Digital Card Controller (SDCC)

Secure Digital Card Controller provides host interface to
SD/MMC/SDIO cards.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "qcom,msm-sdcc"
  - reg : should contain SDCC, SDCC-DML and BAM register map.
  - reg-names : indicates various resources passed to driver (via reg proptery) by name.
  "reg-names" examples are "core_mem", "dml_mem" and "bam_mem"
  - interrupts : should contain SDCC core interrupt.
  - interrupt-names : indicates interrupts passed to driver (via interrupts property) by name.
  "interrupt-names" examples are "core_irq", "bam_irq" and "status_irq"
  - qcom,sdcc-clk-rates : specifies supported SDCC clock frequencies, Units - Hz.
  - qcom,sdcc-sup-voltages: specifies supported voltage ranges for card. Should always be
			specified in pairs (min, max), Units - mV.
  - <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
  "supply-name" examples are "vdd", "vdd-io".

Optional Properties:
	- cell-index - defines slot ID.
	- qcom,sdcc-bus-width - defines the bus I/O width that controller supports.
	- wp-gpios - specify GPIO for write protect switch detection.
	- cd-gpios - specify GPIO for card detection.
	- qcom,sdcc-nonremovable - specifies whether the card in slot is
				hot pluggable or hard wired.
	- qcom,sdcc-disable_cmd23 - disable sending CMD23 to card when controller can't support it.
	- qcom,sdcc-bus-speed-mode - specifies supported bus speed modes by host.
	- qcom,sdcc-current-limit - specifies max. current the host can drive.
	- qcom,sdcc-xpc - specifies if the host can supply more than 150mA for SDXC cards.

In the following, <supply> can be vdd (flash core voltage) or vdd-io (I/O voltage).
	- qcom,sdcc-<supply>-always_on - specifies whether supply should be kept "on" always.
	- qcom,sdcc-<supply>-lpm_sup - specifies whether supply can be kept in low power mode (lpm).
	- qcom,sdcc-<supply>-voltage_level - specifies voltage levels for supply. Should be
	specified in pairs (min, max), units uV.
	- qcom,sdcc-<supply>-current_level - specifies load levels for supply in lpm or
	high power mode (hpm). Should be specified in pairs (lpm, hpm), units uA.

	- gpios - specifies gpios assigned for sdcc slot.
	- qcom,sdcc-gpio-names -  a list of strings that map in order to the list of gpios
	A slot has either gpios or dedicated tlmm pins as represented below.
	- qcom,sdcc-pad-pull-on - Active pull configuration for sdc tlmm pins
	- qcom,sdcc-pad-pull-off - Suspend pull configuration for sdc tlmm pins.
	- qcom,sdcc-pad-drv-on - Active drive strength configuration for sdc tlmm pins.
	- qcom,sdcc-pad-drv-off - Suspend drive strength configuration for sdc tlmm pins.
	Tlmm pins are specified as <clk cmd data>

Example:

	qcom,sdcc@f9600000 {
	/* SDC1 used as eMMC slot */
	cell-index = <1>;
	compatible = "qcom,msm-sdcc";
	reg = <0xf9600000 0x800   // SDCC register interface
		0xf9600800 0x1800  // DML register interface
		0xf9602000 0x2000> // BAM register interface

	interrupts = <123>;
	qcom,sdcc-clk-rates = <400000 24000000 48000000>;
	qcom,sdcc-sup-voltages = <2700 3300>;
	qcom,sdcc-bus-width = <8>; //8-bit wide
	qcom,sdcc-nonremovable;
};
