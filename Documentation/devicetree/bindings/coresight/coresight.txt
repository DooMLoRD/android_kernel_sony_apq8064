* CoreSight Components

CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight architecture
specification and can be connected in various topologies to suite a particular
SoCs tracing needs. These trace components can generally be classified as sinks,
links and sources. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows through the
intermediate links connecting the source to the currently selected sink. Each
CoreSight component device should use these properties to describe its hardware
characteristcs.

Required properties:

- compatible : name of the component used for driver matching
- reg : physical base address and length of the register set(s) of the component
- coresight-id : unique integer identifier for the component
- coresight-name : unique descriptive name of the component
- coresight-nr-inports : number of input ports on the component

coresight-outports, coresight-child-list and coresight-child-ports lists will
be of the same length and will have a one to one correspondence among the
elements at the same list index.

coresight-default-sink must be specified for one of the sink devices that is
intended to be made the default sink. Other sink devices must not have this
specified. Not specifying this property on any of the sinks is invalid.

Optional properties:

- coresight-outports : list of output port numbers of this component
- coresight-child-list : list of phandles pointing to the children of this
			 component
- coresight-child-ports : list of input port numbers of the children
- coresight-default-sink : represents the default compile time CoreSight sink

Examples:

1. Sinks
	tmc_etr: tmc@fc322000 {
		compatible = "arm,coresight-tmc";
		reg = <0xfc322000 0x1000>;

		coresight-id = <0>;
		coresight-name = "coresight-tmc-etr";
		coresight-nr-inports = <1>;
		coresight-default-sink;
	};

	tpiu: tpiu@fc318000 {
		compatible = "arm,coresight-tpiu";
		reg = <0xfc318000 0x1000>;

		coresight-id = <1>;
		coresight-name = "coresight-tpiu";
		coresight-nr-inports = <1>;
	};

2. Links
	funnel_merg: funnel@fc31b000 {
		compatible = "arm,coresight-funnel";
		reg = <0xfc31b000 0x1000>;
